# WuhanVirus_Tracker

A Covid-19 Case Tracker web application developed predominantly using Spring Framework. 
It uses the Spring REST to obtain data from the Center for Systems Science and Engineering 
(CSSE) which is then processed in the Service layer and directed through the controller to 
a web page designed using Thymeleaf Template Engine and Bootstrap 5.0.
